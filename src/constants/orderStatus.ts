 * which transition; this table only decides WHETHER a transition makes
 * sense at all.
 *
 * PLACED    -> CONFIRMED : provider accepts the request
 * PLACED    -> CANCELLED : customer backs out before the provider acts
 * CONFIRMED -> PAID      : set by the Payments module's Stripe webhook —
 *                          never by a direct status PATCH.
 * PAID      -> PICKED_UP : provider hands over the gear
 * PICKED_UP -> RETURNED  : provider marks the gear returned
 *
 * Anything else — skipping a step (PLACED -> PICKED_UP, or CONFIRMED ->
 * PICKED_UP without paying first), moving backwards (RETURNED ->
 * PICKED_UP), or acting on a terminal status (RETURNED/CANCELLED ->
 * anything) — is rejected.
